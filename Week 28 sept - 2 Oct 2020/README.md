# #1 Hackathons
Hey you üöÄ,

This is our first Hackathons at @Oxynum. We gonna work hard to produce our first idea of a project that we thought clearly.

## Idea.kult

What is **Idea.kult** ? During one day we thought about the first subject.

 The goal is to start with an idea that suits us. We have always developed people's ideas by implementing them technicaly. And one of the hard task to do when you create something, is to find people that will, eventualy, believe in your idea to start working with you on it.

So what's better to start producing an idea with an other idea ? üòè

We decided to create **Idea.kult**. The concept is to enable people with ideas to recruit a full team that will help doing:
- Brainstorming
- Produce a MVP
- Work on features that already exists.

To be clear we want to put in contact Creators and Producers. As Joma Tech said: *"If you have an idea and no one in your team... Then your idea, is useless"*. 

**So let's work in order to avoid having useless ideas.**

### Goal of this Hackathons

Prepare yourself to sweat a lot !!! We want your brain to be 100% of its skills.
And the end of those 2 days we should have produce:

- Business Model
- MVP
- Business Plan
- Communication Plan

Do you think we can do it ? Sorry it was not a question. We will.
